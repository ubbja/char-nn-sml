MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

MR. GOODMAN: Give it to me.

MARIO: Wh- Give what to you?

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it. Bring it around town, and tWiSt, ReAlLy, HaRd! And uuuuuuuuuuuHhHhHhHAAAAAH! ..I'm gonna rip your nipple, clean off your chest, Mario. See right here? What do I have in my hand?

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

JEFFY: Well, I don't have nipples! [lifts up his shirt to show that he has no nipples.] See?

MARIO: That's gross, Jeffy.

[Jeffy puts his shirt back down.]

MARIO: I just need quick money tonight! But how

NARRATOR: Yo, yo, yo! Do you need money tonight? Then enter in your most FIRE rap song into the Rap Song Competition! And you can win $50,000!

[Cuts back to the red couch.]

MARIO: Wha-? $50,000?! Just to make some stupid little rap song? I can do it! It can't be that hard! Uh.. Okay, uh.. (clears throat) My name is Mario.. I really need some money.. If I don't get it, then my nipples will be... goney? Wha- I don't know! (sigh) This is stupid! I'm just gonna ask Black Yoshi to make a rap.

JEFFY: Hey, daddy, I can make a rap!

JEFFY: I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, let go of the wheel!

[ The car runs over Hansel.]

MARIO: Jeffy, what was that?! What was that?!

JEFFY: I don't know, daddy. You should have let me drive.

MARIO: Did we hit something?!? Hold on! Oh no! Oh no!!

[Mario steps out of the car and sees Hansel's body]

MARIO: (CONT'D) Oh my god oh my- AAAAH!!! JEFFY!!!!!

JEFFY: What?

MARIO: I RAN OVER A HOMELESS GUY!

JEFFY: Why would you do that daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY YOU WERE GRABBING THE WHEEL YOU MADE ME RUN HIM OVER!

JEFFY: Well daddy, you should have let me drive!

MARIO: (CONT'D) JEFFY YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE! Is he dead? Is he dead?!

JEFFY: What does the mean daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY, I THINK HE'S DEAD!

JEFFY: Well daddy, I got an idea.

MARIO: WHAT!?

JEFFY: Why don't you run him over again?

MARIO: WHY WOULD I DO THAT!?

JEFFY: Because it'd be funny.

MARIO:(CONT'D) Jeffy, it would not be funny! Oh my god. oh- okay Jeffy, help me pick him up.

JEFFY: why?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Because we're going to put him in the trunk, Jeffy, come on. just pick him up! Oh my god. he smells bad...

[Mario and Jeffy put the body in the trunk.]

MARIO: Alright Jeffy, let him down easy.

[Jeffy throws the body down roughly]

MARIO: Jeffy! I said let him down easy!

JEFFY: Uh, daddy, can I ride in the trunk?

MARIO: No Jeffy! you can't ride in the trunk!

JEFFY: WHY DADDY?! THE DEAD GUY GETS TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Sh-sh- J- J- Jeffy don't say that. You know you can't ride in the trunk, Jeffy!

JEFFY: NO DADDY, THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU HIT SOMEONE WITH THE CAR AND THE GET TO RIDE IN THE-

MARIO: (CONT'D) ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! Jeffy! shh! If you be quiet... th- then ride in the trunk. J-Just ride in the trunk.

JEFFY: Great, daddy!

MARIO: Oh my god...

[Cut to Mario driving]

MARIO: Okay, everything's fine! I just hit a guy with my car, but everything's fine, you know! He's in the trunk and no one's going to find out!

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

[Cut back to Mario]

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

Bowser: Oh No!

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

MARIO: Uh, hello?

MR. GOODMAN: Give it to me.

MARIO: Wh- Give what to you?

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it. Bring it around town, and tWiSt, ReAlLy, HaRd! And uuuuuuuuuuuHhHhHhHAAAAAH! ..I'm gonna rip your nipple, clean off your chest, Mario. See right here? What do I have in my hand?

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

[Mr. Goodman leaves.]

[Cut to Jeffy playing with his Cat Piano. Mario arrives.]

MARIO: Oh, my poor nipples!

[Jeffy stops playing with his Cat Piano.]

JEFFY: What's wrong, daddy?

MARIO: Well, Jeffy, if I don't come up with $2,000 by tonight, I'm gonna lose my nipples!

JEFFY: Well, I don't have nipples! [lifts up his shirt to show that he has no nipples.] See?

MARIO: That's gross, Jeffy.

[Jeffy puts his shirt back down.]

MARIO: I just need quick money tonight! But how

[Conveniently, a commercial then begins to play, which advertises a rap contest with a prize of $50,000.]

NARRATOR: Yo, yo, yo! Do you need money tonight? Then enter in your most FIRE rap song into the Rap Song Competition! And you can win $50,000!

[Cuts back to the red couch.]

MARIO: Wha-? $50,000?! Just to make some stupid little rap song? I can do it! It can't be that hard! Uh.. Okay, uh.. (clears throat) My name is Mario.. I really need some money.. If I don't get it, then my nipples will be... goney? Wha- I don't know! (sigh) This is stupid! I'm just gonna ask Black Yoshi to make a rap.

JEFFY: Hey, daddy, I can make a rap!

MARIO: Wh- No you can't, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Yeah I can, daddy. I just need a saxophone.

[Tyrone has just got done watching Toad's rap song at the table. Jeffy and Toad are there as well.]

TYRONE: WOAH! Dis song changes everything! Dis song is fire!

[Mario arrives at the table.]

MARIO: Wh-wh-what's going on?

TYRONE: Man, this song is so good, eh, it might be a tie!

JEFFY: A TIE?! Are you HIGH?!

MARIO: Wh-wh-wha- A tie? Wh-eh- It can't be a tie! You already said Jeffy won!

TYRONE: Look-look-look. It's so good, I think Toad put up a good fight!

[Brooklyn T. Guy arrives to the table with his firefighter suit.]

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Okay, so I got a call about a fire here?

TYRONE: Yeah, yeah yeah, we want you to see which song is the most fire!

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Wha- Which song is the most fire?

TYRONE: Yeah, yeah!

BROOKLYN T. GUY: So you're telling me there's no actual fire here?

TYRONE: ..No? We-we just want you to see which song is better; which song is the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Wh- (sigh) Alright, just- play the songs..

TYRONE: Okay.

[Tyrone hits the laptop keyboard. A fire effect plays. After that, Brooklyn T. Guy appears to be literally burned.]

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Uuugh, yeah! Both of those songs are pretty fire! I.. I think I got third-degree burns on my face!

TYRONE: So, which song was the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Huh.. Well, they were both pretty fire, but.. I got a thing for butts, so I'm gonna go with that one.

TOAD: WOOHOOOO! I won!!

JEFFY: That's BS!

MARIO: Yeah, Jeffy's song was better!

TYRONE: Well, the firefighter has spoken.

MARIO: Wh-?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: I'm gonna go to the hospital now..

[Brooklyn T. Guy leaves.]

MARIO: Oh, man! Jeffy, I-I..I..I-I-I can't beli-e-eve you lo-o-o-o-ost...

[Mario leaves the table. Jeffy starts to leave the table. T-Money is still at the table, with his laptop.]

[Mario and Jeffy are at the couch.]

MARIO: Well, Jeffy, I guess you can say bye bye to my nipples!

JEFFY: Bah-bye, daddy's nipples!

MARIO: (sigh) I was supposed to get $2,000 by tonight!

JEFFY: ..Oh, daddy, I got this! [pulls out $10,000]

MARIO: Wh-? $10,000?!

JEFFY: Yup.

MARIO: Where'd you get that at, Jeffy?!

JEFFY: Oh, I stole it off the pile of money!

MARIO: Wha-? You stole it?!

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy! I'm about that life! I'm on that gangster shizz!

MARIO: Wh-.. Well, I guess.. My nipples are saved!

JEFFY: Yay, daddy's nipples! Let's celebrate, daddy! Let me grab my hoe!

MARIO: Wh- Hoe?

JEFFY: [takes out garden hoe] Here you go, daddy! My main hoe! [nods]

[The  starts at the red couch. Mario is sitting there. Jeffy approaches him.]

JEFFY: Hey um, Daddy? I have a question.

MARIO: What is it, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Um- When I squeeze my ballsack, it turns red and it looks like a strawberry. Is that normal?

MARIO: Wh- Is what normal?!

JEFFY: For my ballsack to look like a strawberry.

MARIO: It's not normal for you to squeeze your ballsack, Jeffy!

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh.. Um, I'm hungry, daddy.

MARIO: Wha- You're hungry?

[Jeffy nods his head.]

MARIO: Well, um... I could make you some green beans!

JEFFY: Say what, daddy?

MARIO: Some green beans!

JEFFY: Um, daddy. c'mere.

MARIO: Wh-w-what?

JEFFY: No, come-come here, I gotta tell you something.

[Mario comes closer.]

MARIO: O-okay, what?

JEFFY: Come, come here.

MARIO: O-okay.

JEFFY: (CONT'D) Um... I HATE GREEN BEANS, DADDY!

MARIO: Jeffy, why did you yell in my ear?!

JEFFY: Daddy, how many times do I have to tell you I don't like green beans?!

MARIO: W-well, I mean, I just- didn't know you hate them that much!

JEFFY: What is it going to take to get it through your THICK, ITALIAN MUSTACHE NOT MATCHING THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR SCHOOL DADDY, to know that I DON'T LIKE GREEN BEANS!!!

MARIO: ..O-okay, Jeffy, I-I-I get it. Y-you don't- You don't like green beans!

JEFFY: I don't like green beans, daddy. I hate them! They're not my favorite!

MARIO: Alright, Jeffy, then what do you want to eat?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Um.. Chicken nuggets!

MARIO: Chicken nuggets? Tha-that's not healthy, Jeffy.

JEFFY: I want chicken nuggets, daddy!

MARIO: Okay, fine! We-we'l-we'll go drive and get some chicken nuggets. Uh, c'mo-

JEFFY: One more thing, daddy.

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: Can I drive?

MARIO: No, you can't drive, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive! Can I drive?!

MARIO: You're not old enough, Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario leaves and Jeffy follows.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

[Mario and Jeffy are now in the car.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, You're not driving, Put your seatbelt on!

[The camera shows Hansel, happily drunk with Budweiser in the middle of the street. Mario's car is approaching him.]

HANSEL: (grunting) Ah yeah. Hehe... Happy birthday to me....

[It cuts back to Mario and Jeffy]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: You're not driving, Jeffy!

[Jeffy grabs the steering wheel]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy! Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario and Jeffy begin fighting over the wheel]

JEFFY: I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, let go of the wheel!

[ The car runs over Hansel.]

MARIO: Jeffy, what was that?! What was that?!

JEFFY: I don't know, daddy. You should have let me drive.

MARIO: Did we hit something?!? Hold on! Oh no! Oh no!!

[Mario steps out of the car and sees Hansel's body]

MARIO: (CONT'D) Oh my god oh my- AAAAH!!! JEFFY!!!!!

JEFFY: What?

MARIO: I RAN OVER A HOMELESS GUY!

JEFFY: Why would you do that daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY YOU WERE GRABBING THE WHEEL YOU MADE ME RUN HIM OVER!

JEFFY: Well daddy, you should have let me drive!

MARIO: (CONT'D) JEFFY YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE! Is he dead? Is he dead?!

JEFFY: What does the mean daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY, I THINK HE'S DEAD!

JEFFY: Well daddy, I got an idea.

MARIO: WHAT!?

JEFFY: Why don't you run him over again?

MARIO: WHY WOULD I DO THAT!?

JEFFY: Because it'd be funny.

MARIO:(CONT'D) Jeffy, it would not be funny! Oh my god. oh- okay Jeffy, help me pick him up.

JEFFY: why?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Because we're going to put him in the trunk, Jeffy, come on. just pick him up! Oh my god. he smells bad...

[Mario and Jeffy put the body in the trunk.]

MARIO: Alright Jeffy, let him down easy.

[Jeffy throws the body down roughly]

MARIO: Jeffy! I said let him down easy!

JEFFY: Uh, daddy, can I ride in the trunk?

MARIO: No Jeffy! you can't ride in the trunk!

JEFFY: WHY DADDY?! THE DEAD GUY GETS TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Sh-sh- J- J- Jeffy don't say that. You know you can't ride in the trunk, Jeffy!

JEFFY: NO DADDY, THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU HIT SOMEONE WITH THE CAR AND THE GET TO RIDE IN THE-

MARIO: (CONT'D) ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! Jeffy! shh! If you be quiet... th- then ride in the trunk. J-Just ride in the trunk.

JEFFY: Great, daddy!

MARIO: Oh my god...

[Cut to Mario driving]

MARIO: Okay, everything's fine! I just hit a guy with my car, but everything's fine, you know! He's in the trunk and no one's going to find out!

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

[Cut back to Mario]

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: This Is What Happened. It Was The Day You Were Born.

(Flashback to Baby Mutant Turtles)

Junior: So You're My Real Mom?

Peach: Yes, Junior.

(Junior and Peach hug)

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

(Shelby walks in)

Bowser: Oh No!

(Shelby is scared)

Peach: DIE BITCH!!!

(Peach beats up Shelby)

Bowser and Junior: Oh Jeez!

(Joseph and Cody come in)

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

(Shelby bites Peach)

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

Cody: Hello?!

Brooklyn T. Guy: Hey I got a Call about some Witchcraft!

Cody: Yes! My Mom Turned into a Real Pig!

Brooklyn T. Guy: I Really Hope I don’t go through this Crap again because One Time # years ago, a Man Told me that his Piggy Bank Turned into a Real Pig and Caused a Panic and we Found out that his Pig was Broken

Cody: Are y'all Talking about Bowser because I was there when it Happened

Brooklyn T. Guy: Yeah! We even got a Report Saying your Mom Turned into a Real Pig!

Cody: Well, my Friends gave me a Potion for my Mom and said that it’ll make her Hunkier, but she Woke up as a Pig! Another Reason that Potion could’ve Turned her into a Pig is that my Friends are A**holes and they Likes to make Jokes about her Calling her a Pig, a Whale and Cow and also Like calling her Fat Names! Junior and Joseph, if you’re Watching this, me and my Mom are on the Way to your House!

Goodman: So that was the Story of what Happened to the Boy’s Mother! To the Kids that made that Potion, if you’re Watching this! Better be on the Lookout because you’ll be Dead Meat soon! Laugh all you Kids Want, you won’t be Laughing when your Recieve Karma!

Cody: Yes! It was my Friends, Junior and Joseph and they have a Word with you!

Brooklyn T. Guy: So why did you Turn Cody’s Mom into a Pig?!

TYRONE: WOAH! Dis song changes everything! Dis song is fire!

[Mario arrives at the table.]

MARIO: Wh-wh-what's going on?

TYRONE: Man, this song is so good, eh, it might be a tie!

[Brooklyn T. Guy arrives to the table with his firefighter suit.]

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Okay, so I got a call about a fire here?

TYRONE: Yeah, yeah yeah, we want you to see which song is the most fire!

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Wha- Which song is the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: So you're telling me there's no actual fire here?

TYRONE: ..No? We-we just want you to see which song is better; which song is the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Wh- (sigh) Alright, just- play the songs..

TYRONE: Okay.

[Tyrone hits the laptop keyboard. A fire effect plays. After that, Brooklyn T. Guy appears to be literally burned.]

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Uuugh, yeah! Both of those songs are pretty fire! I.. I think I got third-degree burns on my face!

TYRONE: So, which song was the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Huh.. Well, they were both pretty fire, but.. I got a thing for butts, so I'm gonna go with that one.

TOAD: WOOHOOOO! I won!!

TYRONE: Well, the firefighter has spoken.

MARIO: Wh-?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: I'm gonna go to the hospital now..

[Brooklyn T. Guy leaves.]

MARIO: Oh, man! Jeffy, I-I..I..I-I-I can't beli-e-eve you lo-o-o-o-ost...

[Mario leaves the table. Jeffy starts to leave the table. T-Money is still at the table, with his laptop.]

[Mario and Jeffy are at the couch.]

MARIO: Well, Jeffy, I guess you can say bye bye to my nipples!

JEFFY: Bah-bye, daddy's nipples!

MARIO: (sigh) I was supposed to get $2,000 by tonight!

JEFFY: ..Oh, daddy, I got this! [pulls out $10,000]

MARIO: Wh-? $10,000?!

JEFFY: Yup.

MARIO: Where'd you get that at, Jeffy?!

JEFFY: Oh, I stole it off the pile of money!

MARIO: Wha-? You stole it?!

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy! I'm about that life! I'm on that gangster shizz!

MARIO: Wh-.. Well, I guess.. My nipples are saved!

JEFFY: Yay, daddy's nipples! Let's celebrate, daddy! Let me grab my hoe!

MARIO: Wh- Hoe?

JEFFY: [takes out garden hoe] Here you go, daddy! My main hoe! [nods]

[The  starts at the red couch. Mario is sitting there. Jeffy approaches him.]

JEFFY: Hey um, Daddy? I have a question.

MARIO: What is it, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Um- When I squeeze my ballsack, it turns red and it looks like a strawberry. Is that normal?

MARIO: Wh- Is what normal?!

JEFFY: For my ballsack to look like a strawberry.

MARIO: It's not normal for you to squeeze your ballsack, Jeffy!

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh.. Um, I'm hungry, daddy.

MARIO: Wha- You're hungry?

[Jeffy nods his head.]

MARIO: Well, um... I could make you some green beans!

JEFFY: Say what, daddy?

MARIO: Some green beans!

JEFFY: Um, daddy. c'mere.

MARIO: Wh-w-what?

JEFFY: No, come-come here, I gotta tell you something.

[Mario comes closer.]

MARIO: O-okay, what?

JEFFY: Come, come here.

MARIO: O-okay.

JEFFY: (CONT'D) Um... I HATE GREEN BEANS, DADDY!

MARIO: Jeffy, why did you yell in my ear?!

JEFFY: Daddy, how many times do I have to tell you I don't like green beans?!

MARIO: W-well, I mean, I just- didn't know you hate them that much!

JEFFY: What is it going to take to get it through your THICK, ITALIAN MUSTACHE NOT MATCHING THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR SCHOOL DADDY, to know that I DON'T LIKE GREEN BEANS!!!

MARIO: ..O-okay, Jeffy, I-I-I get it. Y-you don't- You don't like green beans!

JEFFY: I don't like green beans, daddy. I hate them! They're not my favorite!

MARIO: Alright, Jeffy, then what do you want to eat?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Um.. Chicken nuggets!

MARIO: Chicken nuggets? Tha-that's not healthy, Jeffy.

JEFFY: I want chicken nuggets, daddy!

MARIO: Okay, fine! We-we'l-we'll go drive and get some chicken nuggets. Uh, c'mo-

JEFFY: One more thing, daddy.

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: Can I drive?

MARIO: No, you can't drive, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive! Can I drive?!

MARIO: You're not old enough, Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario leaves and Jeffy follows.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

[Mario and Jeffy are now in the car.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, You're not driving, Put your seatbelt on!

[The camera shows Hansel, happily drunk with Budweiser in the middle of the street. Mario's car is approaching him.]

HANSEL: (grunting) Ah yeah. Hehe... Happy birthday to me....

[It cuts back to Mario and Jeffy]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: You're not driving, Jeffy!

[Jeffy grabs the steering wheel]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy! Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario and Jeffy begin fighting over the wheel]

JEFFY: I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, let go of the wheel!

[ The car runs over Hansel.]

MARIO: Jeffy, what was that?! What was that?!

JEFFY: I don't know, daddy. You should have let me drive.

MARIO: Did we hit something?!? Hold on! Oh no! Oh no!!

[Mario steps out of the car and sees Hansel's body]

MARIO: (CONT'D) Oh my god oh my- AAAAH!!! JEFFY!!!!!

JEFFY: What?

MARIO: I RAN OVER A HOMELESS GUY!

JEFFY: Why would you do that daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY YOU WERE GRABBING THE WHEEL YOU MADE ME RUN HIM OVER!

JEFFY: Well daddy, you should have let me drive!

MARIO: (CONT'D) JEFFY YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE! Is he dead? Is he dead?!

JEFFY: What does the mean daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY, I THINK HE'S DEAD!

JEFFY: Well daddy, I got an idea.

MARIO: WHAT!?

JEFFY: Why don't you run him over again?

MARIO: WHY WOULD I DO THAT!?

JEFFY: Because it'd be funny.

MARIO:(CONT'D) Jeffy, it would not be funny! Oh my god. oh- okay Jeffy, help me pick him up.

JEFFY: why?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Because we're going to put him in the trunk, Jeffy, come on. just pick him up! Oh my god. he smells bad...

[Mario and Jeffy put the body in the trunk.]

MARIO: Alright Jeffy, let him down easy.

[Jeffy throws the body down roughly]

MARIO: Jeffy! I said let him down easy!

JEFFY: Uh, daddy, can I ride in the trunk?

MARIO: No Jeffy! you can't ride in the trunk!

JEFFY: WHY DADDY?! THE DEAD GUY GETS TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Sh-sh- J- J- Jeffy don't say that. You know you can't ride in the trunk, Jeffy!

JEFFY: NO DADDY, THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU HIT SOMEONE WITH THE CAR AND THE GET TO RIDE IN THE-

MARIO: (CONT'D) ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! Jeffy! shh! If you be quiet... th- then ride in the trunk. J-Just ride in the trunk.

JEFFY: Great, daddy!

MARIO: Oh my god...

[Cut to Mario driving]

MARIO: Okay, everything's fine! I just hit a guy with my car, but everything's fine, you know! He's in the trunk and no one's going to find out!

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

[Cut back to Mario]

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: This Is What Happened. It Was The Day You Were Born.

(Flashback to Baby Mutant Turtles)

Junior: So You're My Real Mom?

Peach: Yes, Junior.

(Junior and Peach hug)

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

(Shelby walks in)

Bowser: Oh No!

(Shelby is scared)

Peach: DIE BITCH!!!

(Peach beats up Shelby)

Bowser and Junior: Oh Jeez!

(Joseph and Cody come in)

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

(Shelby bites Peach)

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

[Mario is sitting on the red couch. Jeffy is next to him with his Cat Piano, singing on the microphone that comes with the toy piano.]

JEFFY: Tacos gave me diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea! Tacos gave me diarrhea and it is in my pants!

MARIO: Jeffy, stop it! Don't sing about stuff like that! It's gross!

[The doorbell rings.]

MARIO: Wh-?

JEFFY: Somebody is at the door, at the door, at the door! Somebody is at the door and there is diarrhea in my pants!

MARIO: (sighs)

[Mario gets away from the red couch.]

[Cuts to Mario approaching Mr. Goodman at the front door.]

MARIO: Uh, hello?

MR. GOODMAN: Give it to me.

MARIO: Wh- Give what to you?

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it. Bring it around town, and tWiSt, ReAlLy, HaRd! And uuuuuuuuuuuHhHhHhHAAAAAH! ..I'm gonna rip your nipple, clean off your chest, Mario. See right here? What do I have in my hand?

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

[Mr. Goodman leaves.]

[Cut to Jeffy playing with his Cat Piano. Mario arrives.]

MARIO: Oh, my poor nipples!

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: This Is What Happened. It Was The Day You Were Born.

(Flashback to Baby Mutant Turtles)

Junior: So You're My Real Mom?

Peach: Yes, Junior.

(Junior and Peach hug)

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

(Shelby walks in)

Bowser: Oh No!

(Shelby is scared)

Peach: DIE BITCH!!!

(Peach beats up Shelby)

Bowser and Junior: Oh Jeez!

(Joseph and Cody come in)

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

(Shelby bites Peach)

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it.

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

JEFFY: Well, I don't have nipples! [lifts up his shirt to show that he has no nipples.] See?

MARIO: That's gross, Jeffy.

[Jeffy puts his shirt back down.]

MARIO: I just need quick money tonight! But how

NARRATOR: Yo, yo, yo! Do you need money tonight? Then enter in your most FIRE rap song into the Rap Song Competition! And you can win $50,000!

[Cuts back to the red couch.]

MARIO: Wha-? $50,000?! Just to make some stupid little rap song? I can do it! It can't be that hard! Uh.. Okay, uh.. (clears throat) My name is Mario.. I really need some money.. If I don't get it, then my nipples will be... goney? Wha- I don't know! (sigh) This is stupid! I'm just gonna ask Black Yoshi to make a rap.

JEFFY: Hey, daddy, I can make a rap!

MARIO: Wh- No you can't, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Yeah I can, daddy. I just need a saxophone.

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

Cody: Well, my Friends gave me a Potion for my Mom and said that it’ll make her Hunkier, but she Woke up as a Pig! Another Reason that Potion could’ve Turned her into a Pig is that my Friends are A**holes and they Likes to make Jokes about her Calling her a Pig, a Whale and Cow and also Like calling her Fat Names! Junior and Joseph, if you’re Watching this, me and my Mom are on the Way to your House!

Goodman: So that was the Story of what Happened to the Boy’s Mother! To the Kids that made that Potion, if you’re Watching this! Better be on the Lookout because you’ll be Dead Meat soon! Laugh all you Kids Want, you won’t be Laughing when your Recieve Karma!

Cody: Yes! It was my Friends, Junior and Joseph and they have a Word with you!

Brooklyn T. Guy: So why did you Turn Cody’s Mom into a Pig?!

Junior: Because she does Lots of Unexpected, Promiscuous and Mean Behaviors

Joseph: Yeah! She Likes to Sex with Men without their Consent and Rape Men and she Likes to have Drugs All the Time

Junior: Yeah and she even Called my Friend a R*tard Once!

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Okay, so I got a call about a fire here?

TYRONE: Yeah, yeah yeah, we want you to see which song is the most fire!

TYRONE: ..No? We-we just want you to see which song is better; which song is the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Wh- (sigh) Alright, just- play the songs..

TYRONE: Okay.

[Tyrone hits the laptop keyboard. A fire effect plays. After that, Brooklyn T. Guy appears to be literally burned.]

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Uuugh, yeah! Both of those songs are pretty fire! I.. I think I got third-degree burns on my face!

TYRONE: So, which song was the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Huh.. Well, they were both pretty fire, but.. I got a thing for butts, so I'm gonna go with that one.

[Brooklyn T. Guy leaves.]

MARIO: Oh, man! Jeffy, I-I..I..I-I-I can't beli-e-eve you lo-o-o-o-ost...

[Mario leaves the table. Jeffy starts to leave the table. T-Money is still at the table, with his laptop.]

[Mario and Jeffy are at the couch.]

MARIO: Well, Jeffy, I guess you can say bye bye to my nipples!

JEFFY: Bah-bye, daddy's nipples!

MARIO: (sigh) I was supposed to get $2,000 by tonight!

JEFFY: ..Oh, daddy, I got this! [pulls out $10,000]

MARIO: Wh-? $10,000?!

JEFFY: Yup.

MARIO: Where'd you get that at, Jeffy?!

JEFFY: Oh, I stole it off the pile of money!

MARIO: Wha-? You stole it?!

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy! I'm about that life! I'm on that gangster shizz!

MARIO: Wh-.. Well, I guess.. My nipples are saved!

JEFFY: Yay, daddy's nipples! Let's celebrate, daddy! Let me grab my hoe!

MARIO: Wh- Hoe?

JEFFY: [takes out garden hoe] Here you go, daddy! My main hoe! [nods]

[The  starts at the red couch. Mario is sitting there. Jeffy approaches him.]

JEFFY: Hey um, Daddy? I have a question.

MARIO: What is it, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Um- When I squeeze my ballsack, it turns red and it looks like a strawberry. Is that normal?

MARIO: Wh- Is what normal?!

JEFFY: For my ballsack to look like a strawberry.

MARIO: It's not normal for you to squeeze your ballsack, Jeffy!

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh.. Um, I'm hungry, daddy.

MARIO: Wha- You're hungry?

[Jeffy nods his head.]

MARIO: Well, um... I could make you some green beans!

JEFFY: Say what, daddy?

MARIO: Some green beans!

JEFFY: Um, daddy. c'mere.

MARIO: Wh-w-what?

JEFFY: No, come-come here, I gotta tell you something.

[Mario comes closer.]

MARIO: O-okay, what?

JEFFY: Come, come here.

MARIO: O-okay.

JEFFY: (CONT'D) Um... I HATE GREEN BEANS, DADDY!

MARIO: Jeffy, why did you yell in my ear?!

JEFFY: Daddy, how many times do I have to tell you I don't like green beans?!

MARIO: W-well, I mean, I just- didn't know you hate them that much!

JEFFY: What is it going to take to get it through your THICK, ITALIAN MUSTACHE NOT MATCHING THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR SCHOOL DADDY, to know that I DON'T LIKE GREEN BEANS!!!

MARIO: ..O-okay, Jeffy, I-I-I get it. Y-you don't- You don't like green beans!

JEFFY: I don't like green beans, daddy. I hate them! They're not my favorite!

MARIO: Alright, Jeffy, then what do you want to eat?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Um.. Chicken nuggets!

MARIO: Chicken nuggets? Tha-that's not healthy, Jeffy.

JEFFY: I want chicken nuggets, daddy!

MARIO: Okay, fine! We-we'l-we'll go drive and get some chicken nuggets. Uh, c'mo-

JEFFY: One more thing, daddy.

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: Can I drive?

MARIO: No, you can't drive, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive! Can I drive?!

MARIO: You're not old enough, Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario leaves and Jeffy follows.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

[Mario and Jeffy are now in the car.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, You're not driving, Put your seatbelt on!

[The camera shows Hansel, happily drunk with Budweiser in the middle of the street. Mario's car is approaching him.]

HANSEL: (grunting) Ah yeah. Hehe... Happy birthday to me....

[It cuts back to Mario and Jeffy]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: You're not driving, Jeffy!

[Jeffy grabs the steering wheel]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy! Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario and Jeffy begin fighting over the wheel]

JEFFY: I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, let go of the wheel!

[ The car runs over Hansel.]

MARIO: Jeffy, what was that?! What was that?!

JEFFY: I don't know, daddy. You should have let me drive.

MARIO: Did we hit something?!? Hold on! Oh no! Oh no!!

[Mario steps out of the car and sees Hansel's body]

MARIO: (CONT'D) Oh my god oh my- AAAAH!!! JEFFY!!!!!

JEFFY: What?

MARIO: I RAN OVER A HOMELESS GUY!

JEFFY: Why would you do that daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY YOU WERE GRABBING THE WHEEL YOU MADE ME RUN HIM OVER!

JEFFY: Well daddy, you should have let me drive!

MARIO: (CONT'D) JEFFY YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE! Is he dead? Is he dead?!

JEFFY: What does the mean daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY, I THINK HE'S DEAD!

JEFFY: Well daddy, I got an idea.

MARIO: WHAT!?

JEFFY: Why don't you run him over again?

MARIO: WHY WOULD I DO THAT!?

JEFFY: Because it'd be funny.

MARIO:(CONT'D) Jeffy, it would not be funny! Oh my god. oh- okay Jeffy, help me pick him up.

JEFFY: why?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Because we're going to put him in the trunk, Jeffy, come on. just pick him up! Oh my god. he smells bad...

[Mario and Jeffy put the body in the trunk.]

MARIO: Alright Jeffy, let him down easy.

[Jeffy throws the body down roughly]

MARIO: Jeffy! I said let him down easy!

JEFFY: Uh, daddy, can I ride in the trunk?

MARIO: No Jeffy! you can't ride in the trunk!

JEFFY: WHY DADDY?! THE DEAD GUY GETS TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Sh-sh- J- J- Jeffy don't say that. You know you can't ride in the trunk, Jeffy!

JEFFY: NO DADDY, THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU HIT SOMEONE WITH THE CAR AND THE GET TO RIDE IN THE-

MARIO: (CONT'D) ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! Jeffy! shh! If you be quiet... th- then ride in the trunk. J-Just ride in the trunk.

JEFFY: Great, daddy!

MARIO: Oh my god...

[Cut to Mario driving]

MARIO: Okay, everything's fine! I just hit a guy with my car, but everything's fine, you know! He's in the trunk and no one's going to find out!

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

[Cut back to Mario]

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: This Is What Happened. It Was The Day You Were Born.

(Flashback to Baby Mutant Turtles)

Junior: So You're My Real Mom?

Peach: Yes, Junior.

(Junior and Peach hug)

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

(Shelby walks in)

Bowser: Oh No!

(Shelby is scared)

Peach: DIE BITCH!!!

(Peach beats up Shelby)

Bowser and Junior: Oh Jeez!

(Joseph and Cody come in)

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

(Shelby bites Peach)

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

[Mario is sitting on the red couch. Jeffy is next to him with his Cat Piano, singing on the microphone that comes with the toy piano.]

JEFFY: Tacos gave me diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea! Tacos gave me diarrhea and it is in my pants!

MARIO: Jeffy, stop it! Don't sing about stuff like that! It's gross!

[The doorbell rings.]

MARIO: Wh-?

JEFFY: Somebody is at the door, at the door, at the door! Somebody is at the door and there is diarrhea in my pants!

MARIO: (sighs)

[Mario gets away from the red couch.]

[Cuts to Mario approaching Mr. Goodman at the front door.]

MARIO: Uh, hello?

MR. GOODMAN: Give it to me.

MARIO: Wh- Give what to you?

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it. Bring it around town, and tWiSt, ReAlLy, HaRd! And uuuuuuuuuuuHhHhHhHAAAAAH! ..I'm gonna rip your nipple, clean off your chest, Mario. See right here? What do I have in my hand?

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

[Mr. Goodman leaves.]

[Cut to Jeffy playing with his Cat Piano. Mario arrives.]

JEFFY: Hey, daddy, I can make a rap!

MARIO: Wh- No you can't, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Yeah I can, daddy. I just need a saxophone.

JEFFY: Because it'd be funny.

MARIO:(CONT'D) Jeffy, it would not be funny! Oh my god. oh- okay Jeffy, help me pick him up.

JEFFY: why?

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: This Is What Happened. It Was The Day You Were Born.

(Flashback to Baby Mutant Turtles)

Junior: So You're My Real Mom?

Peach: Yes, Junior.

(Junior and Peach hug)

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

(Shelby walks in)

Bowser: Oh No!

(Shelby is scared)

Peach: DIE BITCH!!!

(Peach beats up Shelby)

Bowser and Junior: Oh Jeez!

(Joseph and Cody come in)

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

(Shelby bites Peach)

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it.

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

JEFFY: Well, I don't have nipples! [lifts up his shirt to show that he has no nipples.] See?

MARIO: That's gross, Jeffy.

[Jeffy puts his shirt back down.]

MARIO: I just need quick money tonight! But how

NARRATOR: Yo, yo, yo! Do you need money tonight? Then enter in your most FIRE rap song into the Rap Song Competition! And you can win $50,000!

[Cuts back to the red couch.]

MARIO: Wha-? $50,000?! Just to make some stupid little rap song? I can do it! It can't be that hard! Uh.. Okay, uh.. (clears throat) My name is Mario.. I really need some money.. If I don't get it, then my nipples will be... goney? Wha- I don't know! (sigh) This is stupid! I'm just gonna ask Black Yoshi to make a rap.

JEFFY: Hey, daddy, I can make a rap!

MARIO: Wh- No you can't, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Yeah I can, daddy. I just need a saxophone.

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

Cody: Well, my Friends gave me a Potion for my Mom and said that it’ll make her Hunkier, but she Woke up as a Pig! Another Reason that Potion could’ve Turned her into a Pig is that my Friends are A**holes and they Likes to make Jokes about her Calling her a Pig, a Whale and Cow and also Like calling her Fat Names! Junior and Joseph, if you’re Watching this, me and my Mom are on the Way to your House!

Goodman: So that was the Story of what Happened to the Boy’s Mother! To the Kids that made that Potion, if you’re Watching this! Better be on the Lookout because you’ll be Dead Meat soon! Laugh all you Kids Want, you won’t be Laughing when your Recieve Karma!

Cody: Yes! It was my Friends, Junior and Joseph and they have a Word with you!

Brooklyn T. Guy: So why did you Turn Cody’s Mom into a Pig?!

Junior: Because she does Lots of Unexpected, Promiscuous and Mean Behaviors

Joseph: Yeah! She Likes to Sex with Men without their Consent and Rape Men and she Likes to have Drugs All the Time

Junior: Yeah and she even Called my Friend a R*tard Once!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Because we're going to put him in the trunk, Jeffy, come on. just pick him up! Oh my god. he smells bad...

[Mario and Jeffy put the body in the trunk.]

MARIO: Alright Jeffy, let him down easy.

[Jeffy throws the body down roughly]

MARIO: Jeffy! I said let him down easy!

JEFFY: Uh, daddy, can I ride in the trunk?

MARIO: No Jeffy! you can't ride in the trunk!

JEFFY: WHY DADDY?! THE DEAD GUY GETS TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Sh-sh- J- J- Jeffy don't say that. You know you can't ride in the trunk, Jeffy!

JEFFY: NO DADDY, THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU HIT SOMEONE WITH THE CAR AND THE GET TO RIDE IN THE-

MARIO: (CONT'D) ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! Jeffy! shh! If you be quiet... th- then ride in the trunk. J-Just ride in the trunk.

JEFFY: Great, daddy!

MARIO: Oh my god...

[Cut to Mario driving]

MARIO: Okay, everything's fine! I just hit a guy with my car, but everything's fine, you know! He's in the trunk and no one's going to find out!

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

[Cut back to Mario]

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

MR. GOODMAN: Give it to me.

MARIO: Wh- Give what to you?

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it. Bring it around town, and tWiSt, ReAlLy, HaRd! And uuuuuuuuuuuHhHhHhHAAAAAH! ..I'm gonna rip your nipple, clean off your chest, Mario. See right here? What do I have in my hand?

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

[Jeffy stops playing with his Cat Piano.]

JEFFY: What's wrong, daddy?

MARIO: Well, Jeffy, if I don't come up with $2,000 by tonight, I'm gonna lose my nipples!

JEFFY: Well, I don't have nipples! [lifts up his shirt to show that he has no nipples.] See?

MARIO: That's gross, Jeffy.

[Jeffy puts his shirt back down.]

MARIO: I just need quick money tonight! But how

[Conveniently, a commercial then begins to play, which advertises a rap contest with a prize of $50,000.]

NARRATOR: Yo, yo, yo! Do you need money tonight? Then enter in your most FIRE rap song into the Rap Song Competition! And you can win $50,000!

[Cuts back to the red couch.]

MARIO: Wha-? $50,000?! Just to make some stupid little rap song? I can do it! It can't be that hard! Uh.. Okay, uh.. (clears throat) My name is Mario.. I really need some money.. If I don't get it, then my nipples will be... goney? Wha- I don't know! (sigh) This is stupid! I'm just gonna ask Black Yoshi to make a rap.

JEFFY: Hey, daddy, I can make a rap!

MARIO: Wh- No you can't, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Yeah I can, daddy. I just need a saxophone.

TYRONE: Look-look-look. It's so good, I think Toad put up a good fight!

MARIO: Wha-

TOAD: Yeah, mine is good, right?

MARIO: Wh-wha-wh-wh-wait, so- so, if the songs are tied, how are we gonna settle this?

TYRONE: Uhhhh, I don't know.. Maybe we should call the fire department and see whose song is the most fire!

MARIO: Wha-wh-

[Brooklyn T. Guy arrives to the table with his firefighter suit.]

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Okay, so I got a call about a fire here?

TYRONE: Yeah, yeah yeah, we want you to see which song is the most fire!

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Wha- Which song is the most fire?

TYRONE: Yeah, yeah!

BROOKLYN T. GUY: So you're telling me there's no actual fire here?

TYRONE: ..No? We-we just want you to see which song is better; which song is the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Wh- (sigh) Alright, just- play the songs..

TYRONE: Okay.

[Tyrone hits the laptop keyboard. A fire effect plays. After that, Brooklyn T. Guy appears to be literally burned.]

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Uuugh, yeah! Both of those songs are pretty fire! I.. I think I got third-degree burns on my face!

TYRONE: So, which song was the most fire?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: Huh.. Well, they were both pretty fire, but.. I got a thing for butts, so I'm gonna go with that one.

TOAD: WOOHOOOO! I won!!

JEFFY: That's BS!

MARIO: Yeah, Jeffy's song was better!

TYRONE: Well, the firefighter has spoken.

MARIO: Wh-?

BROOKLYN T. GUY: I'm gonna go to the hospital now..

[Brooklyn T. Guy leaves.]

MARIO: Oh, man! Jeffy, I-I..I..I-I-I can't beli-e-eve you lo-o-o-o-ost...

[Mario leaves the table. Jeffy starts to leave the table. T-Money is still at the table, with his laptop.]

[Mario and Jeffy are at the couch.]

MARIO: Well, Jeffy, I guess you can say bye bye to my nipples!

JEFFY: Bah-bye, daddy's nipples!

MARIO: (sigh) I was supposed to get $2,000 by tonight!

JEFFY: ..Oh, daddy, I got this! [pulls out $10,000]

MARIO: Wh-? $10,000?!

JEFFY: Yup.

MARIO: Where'd you get that at, Jeffy?!

JEFFY: Oh, I stole it off the pile of money!

MARIO: Wha-? You stole it?!

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy! I'm about that life! I'm on that gangster shizz!

MARIO: Wh-.. Well, I guess.. My nipples are saved!

JEFFY: Yay, daddy's nipples! Let's celebrate, daddy! Let me grab my hoe!

MARIO: Wh- Hoe?

JEFFY: [takes out garden hoe] Here you go, daddy! My main hoe! [nods]

[The  starts at the red couch. Mario is sitting there. Jeffy approaches him.]

JEFFY: Hey um, Daddy? I have a question.

MARIO: What is it, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Um- When I squeeze my ballsack, it turns red and it looks like a strawberry. Is that normal?

MARIO: Wh- Is what normal?!

JEFFY: For my ballsack to look like a strawberry.

MARIO: It's not normal for you to squeeze your ballsack, Jeffy!

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh.. Um, I'm hungry, daddy.

MARIO: Wha- You're hungry?

[Jeffy nods his head.]

MARIO: Well, um... I could make you some green beans!

JEFFY: Say what, daddy?

MARIO: Some green beans!

JEFFY: Um, daddy. c'mere.

MARIO: Wh-w-what?

JEFFY: No, come-come here, I gotta tell you something.

[Mario comes closer.]

MARIO: O-okay, what?

JEFFY: Come, come here.

MARIO: O-okay.

JEFFY: (CONT'D) Um... I HATE GREEN BEANS, DADDY!

MARIO: Jeffy, why did you yell in my ear?!

JEFFY: Daddy, how many times do I have to tell you I don't like green beans?!

MARIO: W-well, I mean, I just- didn't know you hate them that much!

JEFFY: What is it going to take to get it through your THICK, ITALIAN MUSTACHE NOT MATCHING THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR SCHOOL DADDY, to know that I DON'T LIKE GREEN BEANS!!!

MARIO: ..O-okay, Jeffy, I-I-I get it. Y-you don't- You don't like green beans!

JEFFY: I don't like green beans, daddy. I hate them! They're not my favorite!

MARIO: Alright, Jeffy, then what do you want to eat?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Um.. Chicken nuggets!

MARIO: Chicken nuggets? Tha-that's not healthy, Jeffy.

JEFFY: I want chicken nuggets, daddy!

MARIO: Okay, fine! We-we'l-we'll go drive and get some chicken nuggets. Uh, c'mo-

JEFFY: One more thing, daddy.

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: Can I drive?

MARIO: No, you can't drive, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive! Can I drive?!

MARIO: You're not old enough, Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario leaves and Jeffy follows.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

[Mario and Jeffy are now in the car.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, You're not driving, Put your seatbelt on!

[The camera shows Hansel, happily drunk with Budweiser in the middle of the street. Mario's car is approaching him.]

HANSEL: (grunting) Ah yeah. Hehe... Happy birthday to me....

[It cuts back to Mario and Jeffy]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: You're not driving, Jeffy!

[Jeffy grabs the steering wheel]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy! Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario and Jeffy begin fighting over the wheel]

JEFFY: I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, let go of the wheel!

[ The car runs over Hansel.]

MARIO: Jeffy, what was that?! What was that?!

JEFFY: I don't know, daddy. You should have let me drive.

MARIO: Did we hit something?!? Hold on! Oh no! Oh no!!

[Mario steps out of the car and sees Hansel's body]

MARIO: (CONT'D) Oh my god oh my- AAAAH!!! JEFFY!!!!!

JEFFY: What?

MARIO: I RAN OVER A HOMELESS GUY!

JEFFY: Why would you do that daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY YOU WERE GRABBING THE WHEEL YOU MADE ME RUN HIM OVER!

JEFFY: Well daddy, you should have let me drive!

MARIO: (CONT'D) JEFFY YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE! Is he dead? Is he dead?!

JEFFY: What does the mean daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY, I THINK HE'S DEAD!

JEFFY: Well daddy, I got an idea.

MARIO: WHAT!?

JEFFY: Why don't you run him over again?

MARIO: WHY WOULD I DO THAT!?

JEFFY: Because it'd be funny.

MARIO:(CONT'D) Jeffy, it would not be funny! Oh my god. oh- okay Jeffy, help me pick him up.

JEFFY: why?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Because we're going to put him in the trunk, Jeffy, come on. just pick him up! Oh my god. he smells bad...

[Mario and Jeffy put the body in the trunk.]

MARIO: Alright Jeffy, let him down easy.

[Jeffy throws the body down roughly]

MARIO: Jeffy! I said let him down easy!

JEFFY: Uh, daddy, can I ride in the trunk?

MARIO: No Jeffy! you can't ride in the trunk!

JEFFY: WHY DADDY?! THE DEAD GUY GETS TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Sh-sh- J- J- Jeffy don't say that. You know you can't ride in the trunk, Jeffy!

JEFFY: NO DADDY, THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU HIT SOMEONE WITH THE CAR AND THE GET TO RIDE IN THE-

MARIO: (CONT'D) ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! Jeffy! shh! If you be quiet... th- then ride in the trunk. J-Just ride in the trunk.

JEFFY: Great, daddy!

MARIO: Oh my god...

[Cut to Mario driving]

MARIO: Okay, everything's fine! I just hit a guy with my car, but everything's fine, you know! He's in the trunk and no one's going to find out!

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

[Cut back to Mario]

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: This Is What Happened. It Was The Day You Were Born.

(Flashback to Baby Mutant Turtles)

Junior: So You're My Real Mom?

Peach: Yes, Junior.

(Junior and Peach hug)

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

(Shelby walks in)

Bowser: Oh No!

(Shelby is scared)

Peach: DIE BITCH!!!

(Peach beats up Shelby)

Bowser and Junior: Oh Jeez!

(Joseph and Cody come in)

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

(Shelby bites Peach)

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!

[Mario is sitting on the red couch. Jeffy is next to him with his Cat Piano, singing on the microphone that comes with the toy piano.]

JEFFY: Tacos gave me diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea! Tacos gave me diarrhea and it is in my pants!

MARIO: Jeffy, stop it! Don't sing about stuff like that! It's gross!

[The doorbell rings.]

MARIO: Wh-?

JEFFY: Somebody is at the door, at the door, at the door! Somebody is at the door and there is diarrhea in my pants!

MARIO: (sighs)

[Mario gets away from the red couch.]

[Cuts to Mario approaching Mr. Goodman at the front door.]

MARIO: Uh, hello?

MR. GOODMAN: Give it to me.

MARIO: Wh- Give what to you?

MR. GOODMAN: YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT, MARIO!

MARIO: It's not due 'til midnight, and it's only like 8:00!

MR. GOODMAN: ..IT'S MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD!

MARIO: Well, look- I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make my payment tonight.

MR. GOODMAN: Mario, if you don't pay your house payment by midnight tonight, do you know what I'm gonna do to you?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: Purple nurple.

MARIO: Wh- Purple nurple?

MR. GOODMAN: It's when I take your nipple with this hand, see this hand, Mario? ..I'm gonna take your nipple with this hand and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand, and pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! I'm gonna take this hand one more time, see this hand, Mario? See it? Bring it around town, and sQuEeZe AnD tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! And this hand one more time, pick up where I left off and tWiSt ReAlLy HaRd! This hand, Mario, one more time, look at this hand, watch it. Bring it around town, and tWiSt, ReAlLy, HaRd! And uuuuuuuuuuuHhHhHhHAAAAAH! ..I'm gonna rip your nipple, clean off your chest, Mario. See right here? What do I have in my hand?

MARIO: Uh, wh-what?

MR. GOODMAN: Your nipple. Guess what I'm gonna do to your nipple, Mario? ..Ahh.

[Mr. Goodman then pretends to eat Mario's nipple.]

MR. GOODMAN: Yummy your nipple.

MARIO: ..Wh- Tha-tha-that seems like it's gonna hurt!

MR. GOODMAN: Oh yeah. I've only done it twice in my life before. The guy, the guy that I did it to, guess what his name is?

MARIO: What?

MR. GOODMAN: No Nipple Tim. Guess how many house payments No Nipple Tim has missed?

MARIO: Ha-how-how many?

MR. GOODMAN: Zero. ..So if you miss your house payment tonight, Mario, your nickname's gonna be No Nipple Mario. See you later, No Nipple Mario! Kinda has a ring to it.

[Mr. Goodman leaves.]

[Cut to Jeffy playing with his Cat Piano. Mario arrives.]

MARIO: Oh, my poor nipples!

[Jeffy stops playing with his Cat Piano.]

JEFFY: What's wrong, daddy?

MARIO: Well, Jeffy, if I don't come up with $2,000 by tonight, I'm gonna lose my nipples!

JEFFY: Well, I don't have nipples! [lifts up his shirt to show that he has no nipples.] See?

MARIO: That's gross, Jeffy.

[Jeffy puts his shirt back down.]

MARIO: I just need quick money tonight! But how

[Conveniently, a commercial then begins to play, which advertises a rap contest with a prize of $50,000.]

NARRATOR: Yo, yo, yo! Do you need money tonight? Then enter in your most FIRE rap song into the Rap Song Competition! And you can win $50,000!

[Cuts back to the red couch.]

MARIO: Wha-? $50,000?! Just to make some stupid little rap song? I can do it! It can't be that hard! Uh.. Okay, uh.. (clears throat) My name is Mario.. I really need some money.. If I don't get it, then my nipples will be... goney? Wha- I don't know! (sigh) This is stupid! I'm just gonna ask Black Yoshi to make a rap.

JEFFY: Hey, daddy, I can make a rap!

MARIO: Wh- No you can't, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Yeah I can, daddy. I just need a saxophone.

MARIO: Wh- A saxophone?

[Jeffy nods his head.]

["Jeffy - Wanna See My Pencil? 'Music Video'" begins playing, beginning with saxophone intro]

JEFFY: ♪ Wanna-see-myyy pencil?

Wanna-see-myyy pencil?

Wanna-see-myyy pencil?

Wanna-see-myyy pencil?

[takes out pencil] Hey daddy, wanna see my pencil?

[sticks it in his nose] I stick it in my nose, until it hits the middle.

It's yellow, it's special, [starts chewing it] it tastes like a pretzel!

I hit on my head [hits it on his head] to make this instrumental!

I'm mental, I'm crazy, [points to his diaper] diaper like a baby!

Who's the Easter Bunny? You know that it's my daddy.

My rhymes are freakin' hot, you weren't even ready,

[cuts to him with bunny suit on] I got my jammies on, I'm ready for bed-y!

Wanna-see-myyy pencil?

JEFFY: Hey um, Daddy? I have a question.

MARIO: What is it, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Um- When I squeeze my ballsack, it turns red and it looks like a strawberry. Is that normal?

MARIO: Wh- Is what normal?!

JEFFY: For my ballsack to look like a strawberry.

MARIO: It's not normal for you to squeeze your ballsack, Jeffy!

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh.. Um, I'm hungry, daddy.

MARIO: Wha- You're hungry?

[Jeffy nods his head.]

MARIO: O-okay.

JEFFY: (CONT'D) Um... I HATE GREEN BEANS, DADDY!

MARIO: Jeffy, why did you yell in my ear?!

JEFFY: Daddy, how many times do I have to tell you I don't like green beans?!

MARIO: W-well, I mean, I just- didn't know you hate them that much!

JEFFY: What is it going to take to get it through your THICK, ITALIAN MUSTACHE NOT MATCHING THE COLOR OF YOUR HAIR SCHOOL DADDY, to know that I DON'T LIKE GREEN BEANS!!!

MARIO: ..O-okay, Jeffy, I-I-I get it. Y-you don't- You don't like green beans!

JEFFY: I don't like green beans, daddy. I hate them! They're not my favorite!

MARIO: Alright, Jeffy, then what do you want to eat?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Um.. Chicken nuggets!

MARIO: Chicken nuggets? Tha-that's not healthy, Jeffy.

JEFFY: I want chicken nuggets, daddy!

MARIO: Okay, fine! We-we'l-we'll go drive and get some chicken nuggets. Uh, c'mo-

JEFFY: One more thing, daddy.

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: Can I drive?

MARIO: No, you can't drive, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive! Can I drive?!

MARIO: You're not old enough, Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario leaves and Jeffy follows.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

[Mario and Jeffy are now in the car.]

JEFFY: Daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, You're not driving, Put your seatbelt on!

[The camera shows Hansel, happily drunk with Budweiser in the middle of the street. Mario's car is approaching him.]

HANSEL: (grunting) Ah yeah. Hehe... Happy birthday to me....

[It cuts back to Mario and Jeffy]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: You're not driving, Jeffy!

[Jeffy grabs the steering wheel]

JEFFY: No daddy, I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy! Jeffy! You're not driving!

[Mario and Jeffy begin fighting over the wheel]

JEFFY: I want to drive!

MARIO: Jeffy, let go of the wheel!

[ The car runs over Hansel.]

MARIO: Jeffy, what was that?! What was that?!

JEFFY: I don't know, daddy. You should have let me drive.

MARIO: Did we hit something?!? Hold on! Oh no! Oh no!!

[Mario steps out of the car and sees Hansel's body]

MARIO: (CONT'D) Oh my god oh my- AAAAH!!! JEFFY!!!!!

JEFFY: What?

MARIO: I RAN OVER A HOMELESS GUY!

JEFFY: Why would you do that daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY YOU WERE GRABBING THE WHEEL YOU MADE ME RUN HIM OVER!

JEFFY: Well daddy, you should have let me drive!

MARIO: (CONT'D) JEFFY YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE! Is he dead? Is he dead?!

JEFFY: What does the mean daddy?

MARIO: JEFFY, I THINK HE'S DEAD!

JEFFY: Well daddy, I got an idea.

MARIO: WHAT!?

JEFFY: Why don't you run him over again?

MARIO: WHY WOULD I DO THAT!?

JEFFY: Because it'd be funny.

MARIO:(CONT'D) Jeffy, it would not be funny! Oh my god. oh- okay Jeffy, help me pick him up.

JEFFY: why?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Because we're going to put him in the trunk, Jeffy, come on. just pick him up! Oh my god. he smells bad...

[Mario and Jeffy put the body in the trunk.]

MARIO: Alright Jeffy, let him down easy.

[Jeffy throws the body down roughly]

MARIO: Jeffy! I said let him down easy!

JEFFY: Uh, daddy, can I ride in the trunk?

MARIO: No Jeffy! you can't ride in the trunk!

JEFFY: WHY DADDY?! THE DEAD GUY GETS TO RIDE IN THE TRUNK!

MARIO: (CONT'D) Sh-sh- J- J- Jeffy don't say that. You know you can't ride in the trunk, Jeffy!

JEFFY: NO DADDY, THAT'S NOT FAIR YOU HIT SOMEONE WITH THE CAR AND THE GET TO RIDE IN THE-

MARIO: (CONT'D) ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT! Jeffy! shh! If you be quiet... th- then ride in the trunk. J-Just ride in the trunk.

JEFFY: Great, daddy!

MARIO: Oh my god...

[Cut to Mario driving]

MARIO: Okay, everything's fine! I just hit a guy with my car, but everything's fine, you know! He's in the trunk and no one's going to find out!

JEFFY: Hey! Hey daddy!

MARIO: What, Jeffy? [Cut to Jeffy in the trunk]

JEFFY: Um... The dead guy's butthole is really dirty, daddy. It looks like he hasn't wiped in forever.

[Cut back to Mario]

BAKU: (CONT'D) That's great, Jeffy. Alright. We'll just head home and uh... Just hide the body. we'll just hide the body! It's what we'll do, we'll hide the body.

[It cuts back to Mario's home]

Mario: Alright Jeffy, what do we do, Jeffy? what do we do?

JEFFY:(CONT'D) What do we do daddy? You're the one who killed him.

MARIO: Jeffy, I did not kill him, it was an accident!

JEFFY: No daddy, you hit him with your car.

MARIO: Well, you were distracting me, Jeffy!

JEFFY: No, daddy. I had nothing to do with this.

MARIO: (CONT'D) IT'S YOUR FAULT!! A-Alright, Jeffy. Let's just stop arguing. How do we get rid of the body?

JEFFY: Hm....

MARIO: Yeah, how do we get rid of it?...

JEFFY: Oh! I know, daddy!

MARIO: What?

JEFFY: What if we call a magician?

MARIO: (CONT'D) Wha- A magician?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. And he makes him disappear with magic.

[ Jeffy starts to wave his hands around.]

MARIO: (CONT'D) O-Ok. Make the body disappear with magic, but- The magicians' gonna see the dead body, and what if he calls the cops on us?

JEFFY: Oh yeah, you're right.

MARIO: Yeah.

JEFFY: Well, then we kill the magician, daddy.

MARIO: But then we still have a dead body, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Well, then we call another magician.

MARIO: But then, we have to kill THAT magician, Jeffy!

JEFFY: Hmm... Well daddy, we're gonna need a lot of magicians.

MARIO: That's a stupid idea, Jeffy! We're not gonna call a magician, we don't need that! We gotta think of another idea. How do we get rid of a dead body?!

[Suddenly, there is a puff of smoke. It is revealed to be Craig the Devil.]

MARIO: OH MY GOD!! IT'S THE DEVIL!!!

JEFFY: Hey daddy, look! It's SpiderMan!

MARIO: Wha-

CRAIG: Well, that's a first...

MARIO: SpiderMan, Jeffy?

JEFFY: Yeah, daddy. Look, he's red.

MARIO: Jeffy, that's not SpiderMan. That's the Devil.

JEFFY:(CONT'D) Oh. Who's that?

MARIO: The most evil person in the universe!

CRAIG: Whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not that bad!

MARIO: You're the Devil! You're evil!

CRAIG: No, no. I'm a pretty nice guy, really.

MARIO: W-What are you doing here?

CRAIG: Well, I sensed something evil was going on.

MARIO: Wha- there's nothing evil going on here! Nothing evil at all.

CRAIG: ...I'm looking at a dead body here...

MARIO: Wha- Well... I hit him with my car, ok?

CRAIG: YES!! Very good!!!

MARIO: On accident!

CRAIG: Aw..

MARIO: And now, we're trying to get rid of the body so we don't get in trouble...

CRAIG: Good! Good! That is VERY evil!

MARIO: Look, I'm not evil. Just.. Do you know any idea on how to get rid of this body?

CRAIG: Hm... Now, you want him to disappear, yes?

MARIO: Yeah, I would like him to disappear.

CRAIG: Hm... Have you tried calling a magician?

MARIO: A magician?...

CRAIG: Yes! He could make the body disappear with magic!

MARIO: Wha-

JEFFY: I like it, daddy.

MARIO: This is stupid! No! That would never work!

CRAIG: Why?

MARIO: Because the magician might call the cops after he sees the dead body!

CRAIG: Hm... Yes.. Well then, you just kill the magician! But... You're have another body...

MARIO: Yeah.

CRAIG: You would have to have a lot of magicians.

MARIO: I know!

JEFFY: Yeah, like, 5 of them.

MARIO: WE'RE NOT DOING THE MAGICIANS!! OK?! That's stupid!! We're not doing that!

[The video starts off with Mario, Jeffy, and Rosalina on the couch. Jeffy tries to throw up for some reason.]

Mario: Jeffy, stop that! Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm gonna make myself throw up, Daddy.

Mario: Wh.. w... why?

[Jeffy still tries to throw up for some reason]

Mario: J-J-Jeffy, stop it! J-Jeffy S... Stop it, Jeffy! Why do you wanna throw up, Jeffy? Why do you wanna throw up? 

Jeffy: Because I'm bored, Daddy.

Rosalina: Well, why don't we all play a game?

Mario: What, a game?

Jeffy: I want to play a game!

Mario: What game could we all play?

Rosalina: Um, how about hide-and-go-seek?

Jeffy: Hide-and-go-seek?

Mario: Well yes, Jeffy. Hide-and-go-seek, it's a game. Yeah, we can all play that!

Jeffy: What is that?

Mario: Well, it's a game where, uh, basically like- let - let's say you go hide, and then I try to find you.

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Rosalina: It's a game, Jeffy.

Mario: It-it's yeah yeah, it's a game, yeah it's just a game. Yeah we'll play hide and seek, okay? Alright Jeffy, You're gonna count to 20, and then we're gonna go hide and then you're gonna find us, okay?

Rosalina: Um 20, Mario?

Mario: Yeah, he can count to 20. You can count to 20, right Jeffy?

[shakes head]

Mario: What? 15!

[shakes head]

Mario: 10!

[shakes head]

Mario: 5!

Jeffy: What's a 5?

Rosalina: [chuckles] You know what a 5 is, Jeffy.

Jeffy: Uh-huh!

Mario: Oh okay Jeffy, we'l count to 5 while we go hide, okay?

Jeffy: One...

Mario: [whispers] Alright let's go, let's go.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay.

Jeffy: Two...

[Jeffy looks at his left hand, then camera shows his hand while he's looking at his fingers]

Jeffy: Seven... 42 ½..... 60 18 12....[from far distance] 82....

Mario: [whispers] Okay, where should we hide?

Rosalina: Um, how about Jeffy's room?

Mario: [whispers] Jeffy's room?

Rosalina: [whispers] Yeah.

Mario: [whispers] Uh, oh okay, that's good um, let's go hide, let's go hide.

Rosalina: [whispers] Okay, let's go.

Mario: [whispers] Okay, how about we hide underneath his crib?

Rosalina: [whispers] Good idea, Mario.

[Mario and Rosalina crawl and sit underneath his crib]

Mario: Oh yeah, this is a good spot.

Rosalina: Huh?

Mario: W..What?

Rosalina: Now that I think about it, I think we should hide in the easier spot for him.

Mario: An easier spot?

Rosalina: I don't think he's gonna find us down here, Mario.

Mario: Well, that's the point, he's not supposed to find us, it's hide and seek. Let's give him a few minutes, but I bet you he'll find us.

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

[3 hours later, Mario and Rosalina ended up sleeping under Jeffy's crib, then the both wake up]

Mario: [grunts while waking up]

Rosalina: What, Mario?

Mario: Oh, what's going on?... Wait.. ugh.. wha.. He hasn't found us yet?

Rosalina: I guess not.

Mario: W-w?.. Ugh.. I guess the spot was too hard for him.

Rosalina: Uh let's go check on him, Mario.

Mario: Okay let's go, let's go check on him.

Rosalina: Okay.

[As Mario and Rosalina are leaving Jeffy's room, the next shot is on the red couch where Jeffy continues counting random things]

Jeffy: Pizza Hut... rollie pollies... macaroni... um, um, what comes after macaroni?

Mario: Jeffy, what are you doing?

Jeffy: I'm trying to learn my alphabet, daddy, but I don't have a tree.

Mario: What the f*ck are you talking about, Jeffy?!

Rosalina: Mario, don't get mad at him.

Mario: We were waiting 3 hours hiding, and he never came to look for us!

Jeffy: Why would you do that?

Mario: 'Cause we're playing a game, Jeffy, playing hide and seek!

Jeffy: Oh I want to play hide and seek, pick Jeffy to play hide and seek!

Mario: No, I'm done, I'm not playing anymore games.

Rosalina: Mario, maybe he's a better hider than a seeker.

Jeffy: Yep, mommy's right, I can poop. [nodding]

Mario: Okay, okay, fine, alright Jeffy, we're gonna count, and then you're gonna go hide , okay?

Jeffy: Okay, daddy, I can do that.

Mario: Alright so let's start counting. One....

Rosalina: Two...

[Jeffy leaves as he's starting to find a hiding spot]

Mario: Three...

Rosalina: Four...

Mario: Five....

Rosalina: Six...

[Mario and Rosalina continues counting in the background]

Jeffy: Hmm, where should I hide? [Hears loud knock sounds from the other room] What is that? [follows the sounds]

[The next shot shows Jeffy slowly opening the door while listening to the loud knocking sounds; the knocking continues as it goes faster while he is going towards the secret door. Then another shot of the secret door knocks even faster; Jeffy opens the door, makes a shocking expression while seeing something inside the room, and he walks into the room where he's not supposed to.]

Rosalina: Twenty two...

Mario: Twenty three....

Rosalina: Twenty four...

Mario: Twenty five. Ready or not, here we come, Jeffy! Alright, let's go find him.

Rosalina: Okay.

Mario: It's gonna be so easy.

[Meanwhile, Mario and Rosalina are trying to look for Jeffy]

Mario: Where do you think he hid at?

Rosalina: I don't know, Mario.

Mario: He probably hid in a toilet or something.

Rosalina: He wouldn't do that..

[Jeffy screaming in the far distance]

Mario: Jeffy?!

Rosalina: It came from over there, Mario!

Mario: Oh! Oh no, oh no!

[Next shot, Mario and Rosalina finds the door where Jeffy's screaming came from]

Rosalina: [gasps] Oh no, Mario!

Mario: W... We're not supposed to go in there.

Rosalina: I know but Jeffy didn't know that.

Mario: Well it was nice knowing him, you know.

Rosalina: Mario, we have to go in there, we have to save our son!

Mario: We were told not to go in there, so obviously there's something in there that we're not supposed to see, so I'm not going in there.

Rosalina: He screamed, Mario, what if something terrible is going on in there?

Mario: Well it'll be a learning experience, you know don't go in there, don't go into dark places...

Rosalina: Mario, we'll go in together.

Mario: Oh okay, but ladies first.

Rosalina: Mario!

Mario: [sighs] Fine. We're not supposed to go in here.

Rosalina: I know.

Mario: We were told not to go in here, now we're about to break the rules, about break the rules.

Rosalina: Oh no.

Mario: The one rule.

[They enter the dark room]

Mario: Uh.. It's so dark in here.

Rosalina: Oh look, there's a light switch, Mario!

Mario: Really? Oh.....

[turns on light]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Jeffy: [screaming]

[The next screen reveals the room where there hanging and placed corpses to walls, a table, and the floor. While Mario, Rosalina, and Jeffy are having an extreme shock from seeing what's going on with the entire roomful of 26 corpses]

Mario: WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!

Rosalina: [fearful] Mario, what is happening?! Why is there bodies everywhere!?

Mario: Oh no, oh no! Wait-wait-wait, whe- whe-whe- when we've moved in here. The guy said there was 26 people that died inside this house. Maybe that's their bodies!

Rosalina: Why, Mario, we have to call the cops, we have to, please!

Jeffy: Daddy, I'm scared!

Mario: O-okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay, okay, we'll call the cops. Let's go call the cops! We'll call the cops!

Rosalina: [saddened] Okay, we've got to go!

[Cut to Mario and Rosalina at the door with Does Bad Things Guy dressed as a cop]

Mario: Hello officer!

Rosalina: [screaming unintelligibly]

Mario: Officer! Officer, oh my god! There's blood! There's bodies everywhere, there's bodies everywhere!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, alright calm down, calm down, one at a time. Miss, miss, miss, I'm gonna need you to be quiet, and, uh, mustache, tell me what happened.

Mario: So we were playing hide and seek with my son, right? And he opened that door that you told us not to open.

Does Bad Things Guy: He opened the door, that I said not to open.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry, but when we open it, there's bodies everywhere. They're cut in half, there's guts, there's people missing limbs, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: There's bodies, huh?

Mario: Yeah, there's bodies everywhere.

Does Bad Things Guy: I'm uh, I'm gonna need you to show me.

Mario: Oh, oh, okay, come with me, come with me!

[Leads Does Bad Things Guy to the secret room]

Mario: Alright officer! Look! It's in here! Look! See! Look! There's bodies everywhere! Like there's blood! There's bodies! I don't know what's going on! Do you know what's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [whacks Mario with a hammer, Mario blacks out]

[Later, Mario, tied up, wakes up on the floor of the secret room and sees Does Bad Things Guy doing work at a table full of bloody corpses]

Mario: What's going on?

Rosalina: [tied up, screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: What's that? What? Oh good! You're awake! Oh that's good! That's good! I'll be with you in a minute.

Mario: Wha- wha- wha! What's going on? Hey! Hey! What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: [slams bloody axe on table] I said I would be with you in a minute! [looks at woman on table cut in half] You know, she was impatient. Look what happened to her. Alright. [comes to Mario] It's your turn.

Mario: Aah! Aah! What's going on? Oh gosh!

Rosalina: [screaming with tape over mouth]

Does Bad Things Guy: [shushing] Quiet, quiet. See, see, I put tape on your mouth so you wouldn't make noise. See, see, I knew a guy who wouldn't stop making noise. And now look at him.

[Camera zooms in on bloody corpse on the wall]

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: A cat got his tongue, actually, his whole lower jaw. Heh, so, so if I were you, I would recommend that both of you shut your trap! Or else you end up like that guy over there. And judging by the way he acted, he didn't like it too much.

Mario: What's going on? What's going on?

Does Bad Things Guy: See, I told you not to open that. But you did it. And here we are.

Mario: So you kill anybody that opens the door?

Does Bad Things Guy: Well, yeah, you see. You see, it started with my wife. And then some new people moved in. I told them not to open the door. But what did they do? They went and opened it. So I had to kill them and then people just keep opening the door. You know? I liked you people. You were nice, and now. Hey, hang on. I gotta do something. [goes back to table, holding a circular saw] See, I told them not to open the door, but they opened it, and now...! [turns on saw and cuts corpse with it] I just, I gotta cut!

Mario and Rosalina: [both screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: This is what happens! This is what happens! They always open the door! This is what I have to do! Ahh! Woo! Yeah! That's- that's right! That's just what daddy needed!

Mario and Rosalina: [both continue screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: That's exactly what I needed! I thought I told you to shut up! [knocks Rosalina out with mallet]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: Don't you start now! You wanna end up like her?

Mario: Tell me what's going on! Let me go! Let me go!

Does Bad Things Guy: Alright, I will be with you in one minute. [goes back to table holding camera] Let's see here. Oh! Oh yeah, that's a good one! [takes picture of one of the corpses] That is a good one! Yeah! Alright! [Camera prints photo, Does Bad Things Guy looks at printed photo] Oh yeah! Yeah! Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's going on the wall! Mm-hmm! Oh yeah, that's real good! Now let's just, uh... [slices knife through head of one of the corpses] Cut this open here, yeah! And then... Ahh! [holds up decapitated head of corpse, shakes its brain out] Get all that out! Oh, that's good! Yeah! Ooh! Okay! Ah! All right, now I'm ready. [goes back to Mario]

Mario: [screaming]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, I'm ready.

Mario: What's going on? You're a cop! You're a doctor! I don't understand!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, I'm not any of those things. I'm not a cop. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a plumber or a construction worker. No, no, that's- that's not me. I just have the uniforms, you see? See, I killed so many people and I just take the uniforms and I wear them sometimes. See, this is what happens. Whenever you have a problem, you call me. And then I put on one of those uniforms and I crawl out the window and I go and I knock on your front door. And then I do whatever you need me to do. Ha ha! See, I didn't have a problem with you people living here. I liked you. That's why I gave you the house. We wouldn't have any problems if- if you just followed the one simple rule. Just don't open the door! You just had to not open the door, but you did and now here we are.

Mario: Hey, please, just let me go. Just let me out, I promise I won't tell!

Does Bad Things Guy: No, no, no, no, no, no, it's too late for that. I can't let you go anywhere now. You're gonna have to pay the price. I think I'm gonna start with loud-mouth. [drags Rosalina to table]

Mario: [screams]

Does Bad Things Guy: All right, sweetheart, heh, you like being loud, huh? Well, let's cut out your tongue, yeah. That should be worth a picture. [hears Mario screaming] Shut up! You're next! All right, let's see, what do I use for this? Um... Ooh, where's my saw?

[Brooklyn Guy comes in and shoots Does Bad Things Guy]

Brooklyn Guy: Is everybody okay in there? Oh, oh my God, are you okay?

Mario: What is going on?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, I see you met my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Wh- what?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, you see, he does bad things. Look, I'm gonna unchain everybody and then I'm gonna call for some backup and some paramedics. Jesus, this is really messed up, huh? Yeah, so let me just get everybody in chain and then I'll explain, all right?

[cuts to Mario, Rosalina and Jeffy on the couch, Rosalina's head wrapped in plaster]

Mario: Oh, Rosalina, Jeffy, are you okay?

Jeffy: Yeah, daddy.

Rosalina: I'm okay, Mario, but what happened in there?

Mario: I still don't quite understand.

Brooklyn Guy: [enters] Hey there.

Rosalina: AAAH!

Brooklyn Guy: It's okay. It's okay. Just me. Not my brother, just me.

Mario: Well, can you explain what's going on? We don't understand what's going on still.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah. I know. This has got to be really confusing. Okay. So- so here's what happened. Who you met in there? That was my brother, Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah.

Mario: That's his name?

Brooklyn Guy: That's his name. Does Bad Things Guy. You see, you see, I'm Brooklyn Guy. I got a brother, Miami guy, and a Philadelphia guy, and I actually got a brother, Does Good Things Guy. He's actually really nice. He donates money to charity all the time. He's great. But that- that was Does Bad Things Guy.

Mario: So he does bad things?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. He does really, really bad things.

Mario: Well, what was he doing here?

Brooklyn Guy: Well, well, you see, I have a lot of jobs.

Mario: Yeah. You're a doctor and a cop.

Brooklyn Guy: Right.

Mario: Well, you really are those things, right?

Brooklyn Guy: Oh, yeah. I'm definitely a cop and a doctor and all that. But I have a lot of jobs, and I needed a break. So I had to take like seven months vacation, and I needed somebody to fill in for me while I was gone. So I got Does Bad Things Guy to take my place.

Mario: He looks just like you though.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, he's my only identical twin.

Mario: Okay.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah, so he filled in for me for about seven months and just, you know, did all that stuff that I usually do, and I told him to sell this house, which I guess he did 26 times before you, and he killed all those people so... he did some pretty bad things.

Mario: Well, his name is Does Bad Things Guy. What'd you expect?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah? Yeah I'm gonna go my bad on that one. You're right. You're right. I really should have predicted that he'd be doing some bad things.

Mario: Yeah, yeah, 'cause his name is Does Bad Things Guy.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah,

Mario: And he almost killed us.

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, he did and I'm sorry, you know, I- when he said does bad things I thought maybe like steal something not- not murder 26 people. That's that's really bad.

Mario: So what happens now?

Brooklyn Guy: Um, well see now I'm... I'm back. So, you know, I'm good. So you need something you just call me and we're cleaning up that room back there, so hey, you got an extra room in your house, you know, you could put things in there like an attic, you know. You want to do that? I mean, I wouldn't go in there but, but we're cool, right?

Mario: I mean,..

Brooklyn Guy: I'ma- I'ma take off.

Mario: So so so wait, so wait, every single time for the last seven months that you showed up, it wasn't you it was Does Bad Things Guy?

Brooklyn Guy: Yeah. Yeah, probably. Yeah.

Mario: Wha- uh?!

Brooklyn Guy: I mean, yeah, I've been gone. So I'ma go, but yeah, I'm back now. So you need anything you call me. We're good, right? Okay?

Mario: O- o- o- okay.

Brooklyn Guy: I'm gonna just go.

Mario: I'm still so confused. I- Jeffy what made you go inside that room?

Jeffy: Well daddy, I heard knocking, and when I opened the door, it was- it was a guy that was suffering but then he died.

Rosalina: I still don't get it, Mario.

Mario: I'm um, um, I'm confused.

(Peach knocks on the door)

Bowser: Who Is that?

Junior: I'll put this speaking collar on Shelby.

(Bowser sees Peach at the door)

Bowser: PEACH!!???

Peach: Yep.

Bowser: LEAVE!!!

Peach: NO! I Wanna See Junior Again.

(Peach comes in)

(Bowser Junior meets Peach)

Peach: Hi, Son.

Junior: Wait But You Aren't My Mom, Shelby The Real Turtle Is My Mom.

Peach: No. Bowser Lied To You And That Real Turtle Is Just A Cover-Up.

Peach: This Is What Happened. It Was The Day You Were Born.

(Flashback to Baby Mutant Turtles)

Junior: So You're My Real Mom?

Peach: Yes, Junior.

(Junior and Peach hug)

Peach: And I Want To Put An End To This Real Turtle Named Shelby!!

Junior: What Did Shelby Do?

Bowser: Shelby And I Use To Bully Peach When We Were Young.

Peach: AND I'M STILL MAD AT HER!!!

(Shelby walks in)

Bowser: Oh No!

(Shelby is scared)

Peach: DIE BITCH!!!

(Peach beats up Shelby)

Bowser and Junior: Oh Jeez!

(Joseph and Cody come in)

Junior: Hey Guys!

Joseph and Cody: Hey Junior!

Joseph: What's Going On In There?

Cody: I Hear Fighting Noises.

Junior: It's Just My Mom.

Cody: But I Thought Your Mom Was Slow Because She Was A Real Turtle.

Junior: No, It Turns Peach Is My Real Mom And My Dad Used A Real Turtle As A Cover-Up.

Joseph: Can We See The Fight?

Junior: Sure.

(Shelby bites Peach)

Peach: OW!! GET OFF OF ME!!

Bully Bill: This Is So Cool!

Chef Pee Pee: Looks Too Harsh.

Jeffy: Daddy, Who Is That Woman Beating Up A Turtle?

Mario: That's Peach, My Ex!

Jeffy: But Why Is She Beating Up A Turtle?

Rosalina: Oh No!

Mario: I'll Help.

Rosalina: You're Gonna Help The Turtle?

Mario: No, I'm Gonna Help Peach Kick The Turtle's Ass.

Rosalina: No, Mario!

(Peach tries to choke Shelby with legos)

Peach: Stay Off Junior, He's My Son!

Shelby: (with speaking collar) No!, He's Mine!

Rosalina: PEACH, STOP HURTING THE POOR TURTLE!!!

Junior: How Can We Stop This Fight?

Bowser: I Have An Idea. (whispers to Junior)

(Bowser and Junior use a wagon and push Peach and Shelby out of the house)

Peach: This Ain't Over, Shelby!.

Shelby (with speaking collar): This Isn't The End Of Us!.

Chef Pee Pee: That's Was A Long Battle.

Bowser: You're Right.

(The Next Day)

Junior: Well That Was A Long Day Yesterday, Right Guys?

Joseph: Yeah, Dude!.

Joseph: At Least You Got To See Your Real Mom, Junior.

Cody: Yeah, We Will Never Forget That Fight. (scared)

Goodman: You owe me a thousand dollars of your house payment.

Marvin: Says the man who had sex with my ex-wife and then denied me about it.

Goodman: What did you say?

Marvin: Oh, come on! I just had problems with Rose. I already had problems with you!

Goodman: You only have 24 hours to pay for house payment or else i'm gonna evict your ass, eat his balls and murder you!

Marvin: Come on! Why are you always doing this to me!

Goodman: Because since you chainsawed the couch from your last apartment, i have to make you pay me your house payment every month for the rest of your life!

Marvin: But i wasn't even at my apartment when the couch was destroyed!

Goodman: Don't you lie to me, Marvin! You know what? Since you lied to me about it, i'm gonna take your girlfriend and have her as my sex slave if you don't pay me your house payment!

Marvin: What? You mean the last time you took Rose as your sex slave. Is this why Benjamin was born? You impregnanted her like that.

Goodman: (enraged) YES!! AND IT WILL BE HER IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME YOUR HOUSE PAYMENT BY THE END OF THE DAY! SO DO IT RIGHT NOOOOOOOOWWW!!!!

Marvin: Okay okay!

Child Services Problem
Rose: (phone) Jeffy, what's wrong? You sound really upset.

Jeffy: (crying) Oh, Mommy! It's terrible! Daddy was being so mean to me! I accidentally broke his favorite cup, then he starts screaming and beating me up! He locked me in my room, i have so many bruises!

Rose: Oh my god! I am so sorry to hear that! Tell you what, how about i go and speak to him about his abuse on you.

Jeffy: That's great. Thank you.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

Rose: I need to speak to you about this abuse!

Marvin: Look i don't have time to deal with you right now.

Marvin: For what?! I didn't do anything wrong!

Rose: Yes you did! You were beating up your own son just for breaking your-

Marvin: (sarcastically) Oh boo-hoo-hoo! I hurt Jeffy's stupid face!

Rose: I'm warning you, Marvin! You stop being so tough on him right now!

Marvin: No! I'm not doing it. He broke my favorite cup, so i had to punish him! He's gonna be doing more chores for three months with no sleep!

Rose: This isn't fair! He might die of sleep deprivation!

Marvin: (snarky) Well he deserves it, because he broke my favorite cup! You're just a terrible mother and no one loves you!

(Rose begins to throw a tantrum like a toddler just because he's beating Jeffy.)

Marvin: You know what?! If you're gonna behave like a baby, then i'm gonna treat you like a baby!

Rose: You're always mean to Jeffy!

Marvin: Well it's YOUR fault for making me take care of him! What kind of idiot would ever want a son who is as stupid as you!

Rose: Screw you, Marvin!

(Rose runs away.)

Rose: (off-screen) And you better apologize to Jeffy by the time i get back!

Marvin: NO! I AM NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE FOR DOING WHAT'S RIGHT FOR MY SON! I WAS ONLY PUNISHING HIM BECAUSE HE BROKE MY FAVORITE CUP!

(Marvin runs.)

Marvin: JEFFY!!!

Jeffy: (upset) What.

Marvin: What's the big deal, Jeffy! Why did you call that Child Services lady! I got in trouble because of you!

Jeffy: Here, daddy. Here's your dinner.

(Jeffy gives Marvin and Peach some burned dinner.)

Marvin: What the- Jeffy, what is this?

Jeffy: It's chicken nuggets. Don't you like chicken nuggets?

(Marvin sees this and becomes enraged by how burned they are.)

Marvin: THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS! THEY'RE ALL BURNED! WHY DID YOU BURN THEM!

Jeffy: (upset) I don't know how to cook!

Marvin: Oh! YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK! THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU! I ASKED YOU TO COOK ME AND PEACH JUST ONE DINNER AND YOU HAD TO BURN IT! ARE YOU TRYING TO MESS WITH ME?!

Jeffy: It was an accident!

Marvin: AN ACCIDENT? YOU THINK THIS WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT?! YOU SHOULD'VE LEARN HOW TO COOK BETTER!!

Peach: Yeah, Jeffy! You gotta stop cooking food like that. You have a rock for a brain?

Jeffy: Well i can't cook because you wouldn't let me sleep yesterday!

Marvin: THAT'S BECAUSE YOU BROKE MY CUP AND YOU CALL THAT CHILD SERVICES LADY TO GET ME IN TROUBLE! YOU KNOW WHAT! I'M DONE WITH THIS! SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK, YOU'RE DOUBLE GROUNDED!!

Jeffy: Child Services Mommy should've told you that!

Marvin: WELL CHILD SERVICES MOMMY SHOULD'VE REALIZE WHAT A COMPLETE RETARD YOU ARE LIKE HER!! YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THE CHORES AND HOUSEWORK FOR SIX MONTHS! Because if you don't, i will....murder....you! I don't like the word "kill" anymore, it's a bad term. I WILL MURDER YOU!!! GOT IT!

(Jeffy sadly walks away.)

Peach: That kid needs his brain fixed.

Marvin: JEFFY!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR!

Jeffy: Hey, daddy!

Junior: Hey, Jeffy’s dad.

(Marvin groans in anger.)

Marvin: YOU CRASHED MY CAR INTO A TREE?! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you crashing my car into a tree. (points to Junior) And you, you're just as guilty as he is. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're fixing it too, don't worry!

(Rose appears and sees Marvin yelling at Jeffy for crashing his car into a tree.)

‘’Marvin’’ (still angry) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?! YOU WANT ME TO BE ANGRY?! I CAN BE EXTREMELY ANGRY?! I’M REALLY ANGRY?! I’M THE ANGRIEST MAN IN THE WORLD?!

Jeffy: Daddy’s gone completely insane, Junior.

Marvin: I’M SO ANGRY, I COULD STRANGLE YOU?! I’M GONNA-

Rose: (off-screen) Marvin!

(Rose appears right behind Marvin.)

Rose: What’s going on in here?! Why are you yelling at Jeffy! And where’s my child support payment!

Marvin: Oh, Rose! Something terrible happened. My stupid son and his stupid friend went on a joyride, crashing into houses, and then they ended up crashing into a tree!

Rose: What?!

Junior: Ma’am, it’s not true. You see, Jeffy and i are just hanging out, when his maniac dad burned down our school and tried to ran us over and murder us and burn down our school, but ended up crashing HIS car into a tree. Now he's just trying to blame it on us because he doesn't wanna go to jail.

(Rose glares at Marvin like he’s a murderer.)

Rose: (angry) So you’re gonna lie to me, Marvin? You were gonna ran over your own son?! Is this your way of being a good father?

Marvin: Come on, Rose! Jeffy and his friend burned the school down and crashed my car into a tree!

Rose: That’s ridiculous, Marvin! Jeffy can’t drive or kill people because he’s mentally disabled!

Marvin:

(Rose is shocked and appalled by what he said.)

Jeffy: Uh-oh. Daddy’s in trouble.

Junior: Yeah, he’s gonna get it!

Rose: How could you say those horrible things about me and Jeffy like that! You know what? I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR JEFFY ANYMORE!

Marvin: What! Come on! You can't do that!

Rose: Well too bad! So just stay away from him if you're gonna be an evil child abuser! And if you ever tried hurting Jeffy again, you’ll go to jail FOREVER!!!

(Rose walks away, leaving Marvin appalled and enraged.)

Marvin: YOU'RE THE WORST PARENT EVER!! NO WONDER WHY I MARRIED YOU!

Jeffy: Uh-oh! Looks like you’re in trouble, daddy!

(Jeffy and Junior sing a taunting song.)

Jeffy and Junior: (singing) Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trouble! Daddy’s in trou-

Marvin: SHUT UP, JEFFY! GET IN THE HOUSE!!!

Marvin: YOU THINK ME GETTING YELLED AT WAS FUNNY?! DO YOU?! YOU THINK COMMITING ARSON AND GENOCIDE WAS COOL?! HUH?! DO YOU?!

Junior: (crying) I'm sorry! It's not our fault! This was all Jeffy's idea. I swear.

Marvin: DON'T YOU LIE TO ME! YOU WANTED TO BURN DOWN THE SCHOOL! WHY DID YOU AND JEFFY BURNED DOWN THE SCHOOL?!

Junior: We were only doing that because we don't like school! School is so stupid and dumb!

(Marvin continues to strangle Junior.)

Marvin: NO IT'S NOT! YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID AND DUMB LIKE JEFFY!! YOU HAVE GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE FOR THE LAST TIME! I AM DONE WITH THIS! I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR ME OR JEFFY AGAIN!

Junior: This isn't fair! You're the worst dad ever! No one Jeffy has you!

Marvin: Oh sure! Like i'm gonna be criticized by a bratty little tyrant with horns on his head! I DON'T CARE! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I HAD TO BE A FATHER!

(Marvin enters the living room.)

Peach: So how is it going?

Marvin: (upset) This is terrible, Peach! Jeffy and Junior stole my car, burned the school and now Rose banned me from ever near Jeffy again!

Peach: That's horrible. What kind of Child Protective Service agent is she?

Marvin: I know! Why am i gonna do! This is all Jeffy's fault! How am i ever gonna punish him without going near him! He always gets away with anything and i always get the blame!

(Marvin cries while Peach comforts him.)

Peach: That little bastard isn't gonna get away with this! I know just what to do.

Marvin: That was the most amazing vacation ever.

(Rose stands here in anger.)

Rose: Marvin!

Marvin: What? What are you doing here?

Rose: I have been waiting a whole month for you to come back! The entire house has been in lockdown and Jeffy is still neglected!

Marvin: Really? Well you told me not to go anywhere near Jeffy because i’m…”hurting him”.

Rose: Yeah, but i didn’t mean for you to leave him home alone! What if something bad might happen to him!

Peach: Hey leave him alone, you crybaby! Don’t you have anything else to do besides yelling at him! If it wasn’t for him, Jeffy would’ve turned into an evil criminal, unfit for common society!

Peach: Listen here, Rose. That boy is gonna make us millions! So if you take Jeffy away from us, we’ll lose that million dollars from him, and when we lose that million dollars, we’re gonna sue you!

Rose: You couldn’t sue a child services agent. It’s impossible.

Peach: Maybe if i sue you, he'll pay off Goodman so he won't evict us and he'll never bother him again.

(Mario opens the front door.)

Marvin: Jeffy! Did you learn your lesson? Did you really regret getting me in trouble?

(Marvin sees that the living room is dark and scary with so many drawings all over.)

Marvin: (angry) No he didn’t. JEFFY! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW!

(Marvin walks around the house.)

Marvin: I swear to god if i find you, i’m gonna-

(He steps on what is revealed to be Goodman’s mutilated corpse. Marvin screams in fear.)

Marvin: (scared) AAAHH!! GOODMAN!!! NOOOO!!!! He’s dead! But at least he’s not going to bother me anymore. (happy) Yeah, that’s a good thing!

(Marvin walks into the kitchen, which is ruined.)

Marvin: Okay. When i find Jeffy, i'm gonna beat him so hard.

(Marvin runs out of the house and pants for a moment. Rose is facing Marvin with a smug.)

Marvin: (panicking) What the- WHAT IS THAT THING! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE! AND WHERE’S JEFFY!

Rose: That thing IS Jeffy, in his natural, unsupervised state.

Marvin: WHAT?! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!

Rose: Nothing. I was just coming to look for you, only to see that Jeffy has transformed into a vicious, blood-thirsty gremlin all because you left him abandoned and locked in the house for an entire month!

Marvin: (angry) Oh, really? You must have done something that turned him into a gremlin, just so you can get revenge on me! I knew it! YOU TURNED MY SON INTO A GREMLIN, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER ARE YOU!

Rose: I did not turn him into a gremlin, the house is entirely locked and he was like this when i saw him!

Marvin: DON’T YOU LIE TO ME! You know what, i can’t take this anymore, i’m gonna call the police!

Rose: It doesn’t matter, Marvin. They’re gonna know you abandoned him for a month, then you’ll go to jail and i’ll take Jeffy away from you.

Marvin: Well you're the one who told me not to go near him! I did it to teach him a lesson, but you had to go inside and ruin everything for me! The cop was dead because Jeffy killed him!

(Marvin and Rose hear a crash.)

Marvin: What was that?

Marvin: Oh no. Jeffy has got Peach! That’s it, i’m gonna go out there and murder him!

Rose: No! Violence isn’t going to solve anything! If you’re going to stop Jeffy, you’ll have to do it my way.  There are three rules. One: stay calm and do not raise your voice. It just tells him that he’s winning. Two: never turn your back on him. That's when he takes advantage. And three: always asks him very politely, he only responds to kindness.

Marvin: (angry) No! I’m not gonna do your sappy smooshy-wooshy lovey-dovey nonsense! Why can’t we do things my way! Tough love is the answer to parenting!

Rose: We either do it my way or (insert threat here).

(Marvin begrudgingly agrees.)

Marvin: (groans) Fine, we’ll do it your way! But i’ll bet your way sucks!
